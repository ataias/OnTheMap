= OnTheMap

This is an app made as part of the iOS Developer course from Udacity. The summary is:


> The On The Map app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves “on the map,” so to speak.
> -- Udacity, App Specification for On the Map iOS App Project


For what is worth, the available API from Udacity for this app uses fake data, so it presents odd behaviour sometimes. In particular, I saw the endpoint to get public user data vary the structure between a dictionary with a wrapped object `{ "user": { ... } }` and also unwrapped `{ ... }`. In this project I just assume the first one always happens. This endpoint also has missing data sometimes, like the first name and last name.
